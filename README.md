# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
The data sourced from IBM Watson Analytics. The purpose is to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on its background 
and behavior. After data cleaning, we built logistic regression model and select the top 3 relevant features to further build decision
tree and random forest model and optimize them. Then we find after optimization, random forest model has the highest accuracy for prediction.
